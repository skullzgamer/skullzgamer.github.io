Did you know that the source is created to be perfect? Go ahead, press <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>U</kbd>. Granted, the actual ShopifyLiquid code that creates that source doesn't look nearly as pretty, but it's still a good final render. I can't actually control the bad looks of the DM content, however. It doesn't take much account into whitespace and tabs.

Oh yeah, did I mention you can import these libraries by just replacing `false` with `true`?:
* jQuery (not enabled by default, we don't use it)
* ClipboardJS (copy to clipboard buttons on code elements)
* AnchorJS (deep links to each paragraph and heading, the #s)
* MathJax (but I recommend using jekyll-katex)
