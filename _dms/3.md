This DM demonstrates how you can easily hack the widgets on them, like date, credit/author, label, and attachment (somewhat).

* Date: A string  
* Credit/Author: A \<span\> that looks like a DM mention, hyperlinked to `#`.  
* Attachment: A `mailto` link (the attachment is already in a href element)  
* Label: A link pointing to #

Unfortunately, the label is the only string that becomes markdownified at page render.
